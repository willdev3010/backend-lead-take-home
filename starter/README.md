# Mini Wallet Service - Starter

This is the starter codebase for the Backend Lead take-home. The task itself is described in [`../readme.md`](../readme.md).

## Stack

TypeScript, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Jest. Money is `DECIMAL(36,18)` in Postgres, strings in JS/JSON, and all arithmetic goes through `bignumber.js` (see `src/lib/money.ts`).

## Setup

Requires Node 20+ and Docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run db:up        # starts Postgres on localhost:5439 (dev + test databases)
npm run db:migrate   # migrates the dev database
npm test             # migrates the test database and runs the test suite
npm run dev          # starts the API on :3000
```

If port 5439 clashes with something on your machine, change it in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`.

## Layout

```

├── app.ts               # express app factory
├── index.ts             # entrypoint
├── config.ts
├── lib/money.ts         # BigNumber helpers - use these for all money math
├── db/
│   ├── sequelize.ts
│   ├── cli-config.js    # sequelize-cli config (used by npm run db:migrate)

```

## Conventions to keep

- Money never touches JS `number`. Strings at the boundaries, BigNumber in between.
- Any operation writing more than one row runs in a single DB transaction (see `memberService.createMember`).
- Routes validate input with zod and delegate to services; business logic lives in services, not routes.
- New tables are created via migrations, not `sync()`.
